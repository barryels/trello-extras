# Trello Extras (Userscript)

Some extra functionality I wish they would add to Trello by default, including:

- List search; Simply filters the lists' cards based on a match to the cards' titles
- Supports card points (useful for Agile-based story point tracking), simply structure the card title as such: "(3) Whatever"
- Displays a list card count (works in conjuction with list search)
